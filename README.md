1/18/23 - Creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors game to be played in the console using JavaScript.

The game should end when the player or computer reaches 5 wins - solved, a for loop was used to track the score.

The game runs successfully inside the console.

1/26/23 - Creating a UI for the game in the browser. Added event listeners for each button, the running score displays in a p element that is created on first run. The results of each individual round is displayed below the score in another p element. Once either the player or the computer wins 5 rounds, the rock, paper, and scissors buttons become disabled, an h2 element is created and displays the winner and final score, and a play again button is created. When play again is clicked, the game resets the scores to zero and the rock, paper, and scissors buttons are enabled.

The UI is styled with flexbox, will continue to update.
